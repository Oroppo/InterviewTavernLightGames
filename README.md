# InterviewTavernLightGames
    Within this repository are simple correction/improvements of code supplied by Tavernlight Games.
    
    Throughout each question I list any changes made and a short rationale for why.

    I have done extensive commenting/documentation so that you may understand my thought processes.

## All questions are completed on the assumptions that:

- Corrections are only required for the functions listed
- Functionality of methods/variables that exist outside of the question work as intended
